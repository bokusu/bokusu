  title: Trakt API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: >-
    At Trakt, we collect lots of interesting information about what tv shows and
    movies everyone is watching. Part of the fun with such data is making it
    available for anyone to mash up and use on their own site or app. The Trakt
    API was made just for this purpose. It is very easy to use, you basically
    call a URL and get some JSON back.


    More complex API calls (such as adding a movie or show to your collection)
    involve sending us data. These are still easy to use, you simply POST some
    JSON data to a specific URL.


    Make sure to check out the [**Required
    Headers**](#introduction/required-headers) and
    [**Authentication**](#reference/authentication-oauth) sections for more info
    on what needs to be sent with each API call. Also check out the
    [**Terminology**](#introduction/terminology) section insight into the
    features Trakt supports.


    # Create an App


    To use the Trakt API, you'll need to [**create a new API
    app**](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new).


    # Stay Connected


    API discussion and bugs should be posted in the [**GitHub Developer
    Forum**](https://github.com/trakt/api-help/issues) and *watch* the
    repository if you'd like to get notifications. Make sure to follow our
    [**API Blog**](https://apiblog.trakt.tv) and [**@traktapi on
    Twitter**](https://twitter.com/traktapi) too.


    # API URL


    The API should always be accessed over SSL.


    ```

    https://api.trakt.tv

    ```


    If you would like to use our sandbox environment to not fill production with
    test data, use this URL over SSL. **Note:** Staging is a completely separate
    environment, so you'll need to [**create a new API app on
    staging**](https://staging.trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new).


    ```

    https://api-staging.trakt.tv

    ```


    # Verbs


    The API uses restful verbs.


    | Verb | Description |

    |---|---|

    | `GET` | Select one or more items. Success returns `200` status code. |

    | `POST` | Create a new item. Success returns `201` status code. |

    | `PUT` | Update an item. Success returns `200` status code. |

    | `DELETE` | Delete an item. Success returns `200` or `204` status code. |


    # Status Codes


    The API will respond with one of the following HTTP status codes.


    | Code | Description |

    |---|---|

    | `200` | Success

    | `201` | Success - *new resource created (POST)*

    | `204` | Success - *no content to return (DELETE)*

    | `400` | Bad Request - *request couldn't be parsed*

    | `401` | Unauthorized - *OAuth must be provided*

    | `403` | Forbidden - *invalid API key or unapproved app*

    # Required Headers


    You'll need to send some headers when making API calls to identify your
    application, set the version and set the content type to JSON.


    | Header | Value |

    |---|---|

    | `Content-type` <span style="color:red;">*</a> | `application/json` |

    | `trakt-api-key` <span style="color:red;">*</a> | Your `client_id` listed
    under your Trakt applications. |

    | `trakt-api-version` <span style="color:red;">*</a> | `2` | API version to
    use.


    All `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` methods require a valid OAuth
    `access_token`. Some `GET` calls require OAuth and others will return user
    specific data if OAuth is sent. Methods that &#128274; **require** or have
    &#128275; **optional** OAuth will be indicated.


    Your OAuth library should take care of sending the auth headers for you, but
    for reference here's how the Bearer token should be sent.


    | Header | Value |

    |---|---|

    | `Authorization` | `Bearer [access_token]` |


    # Rate Limiting


    All API methods are rate limited. A `429` HTTP status code is returned when
    the limit has been exceeded. Check the headers for detailed info, then try
    your API call in `Retry-After` seconds.


    | Header | Value |

    |---|---|

    | `X-Ratelimit` |
    `{"name":"UNAUTHED_API_GET_LIMIT","period":300,"limit":1000,"remaining":0,"until":"2020-10-10T00:24:00Z"}`
    |

    | `Retry-After` | `10` |


    Here are the current limits. There are separate limits for authed (user
    level) and unauthed (application level) calls. We'll continue to adjust
    these limits to optimize API performance for everyone. The goal is to
    prevent API abuse and poor coding, but allow users to use apps normally.


    | Name | Verb | Methods | Limit |

    |---|---|---|---|

    | `AUTHED_API_POST_LIMIT` | `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | all | 1 call per
    second |

    | `AUTHED_API_GET_LIMIT` | `GET` | all | 1000 calls every 5 minutes |

    | `UNAUTHED_API_GET_LIMIT` | `GET` | all | 1000 calls every 5 minutes |


    # Locked User Account


    A `423` HTTP status code is returned when the OAuth user has a locked user
    account. Please instruct the user to [**contact Trakt
    support**](https://support.trakt.tv) so we can fix their account. API access
    will be suspended for the user until we fix their account.


    # VIP Methods


    Some API methods are tagged 🔥 **VIP Only**. A `426` HTTP status code is
    returned when the user isn't a VIP, indicating they need to sign up for
    [**Trakt VIP**](https://trakt.tv/vip) in order to use this method. In your
    app, please open a browser to `X-Upgrade-URL` so the user can sign up for
    Trakt VIP.


    | Header | Value |

    |---|---|

    | `X-Upgrade-URL` | `https://trakt.tv/vip` |


    Some API methods are tagged 🔥 **VIP Enhanced**. A `420` HTTP status code is
    returned when the user has exceeded their account limit. Signing up for
    [**Trakt VIP**](https://trakt.tv/vip) will increase these limits. If the
    user isn't a VIP, please open a browser to `X-Upgrade-URL` so the user can
    sign up for Trakt VIP. If they are already VIP and still exceeded the limit,
    please display a message indicating this.


    | Header | Value |

    |---|---|

    | `X-Upgrade-URL` | `https://trakt.tv/vip` |

    | `X-VIP-User` | `true` or `false` |

    | `X-Account-Limit` | Limit allowed. |


    # Pagination


    Some methods are paginated. Methods with &#128196; **Pagination** will load
    1 page of 10 items by default. Methods with &#128196; **Pagination
    Optional** will load all items by default. In either case, append a query
    string like `?page={page}&limit={limit}` to the URL to influence the
    results.


    | Parameter | Type | Default | Value |

    |---|---|---|---|

    | `page` | integer | `1` | Number of page of results to be returned. |

    | `limit` | integer | `10` | Number of results to return per page. |


    All paginated methods will return these HTTP headers.


    | Header | Value |

    |---|---|

    | `X-Pagination-Page` | Current page. |

    | `X-Pagination-Limit` | Items per page. |

    | `X-Pagination-Page-Count` | Total number of pages. |

    | `X-Pagination-Item-Count` | Total number of items. |


    # Extended Info


    By default, all methods will return minimal info for movies, shows,
    episodes, people, and users. Minimal info is typically all you need to match
    locally cached items and includes the `title`, `year`, and `ids`. However,
    you can request different extended levels of information by adding
    `?extended={level}` to the URL. Send a comma separated string to get
    multiple types of extended info.


    > ### 🅽🅾🆃🅴

    > _This returns a lot of extra data, so please only use extended parameters
    if you actually need them!_


    | Level | Description |

    |---|---|

    | `full` | Complete info for an item.

    | `metadata` | **Collection only.** Additional video and audio info.


    # Filters


    Some `movies`, `shows`, `calendars`,  and `search` methods support
    additional filters and will be tagged with &#127898; **Filters**. Applying
    these filters refines the results and helps your users to more easily
    discover new items.


    Add a query string (i.e. `?years=2016&genres=action`) with any filters you
    want to use. Some filters allow multiples which can be sent as comma
    delimited parameters. For example, `?genres=action,adventure` would match
    the `action` OR `adventure` genre.


    > ### 🅽🅾🆃🅴

    > _Make sure to properly URL encode the parameters including spaces and
    special characters._


    #### Common Filters

    # CORS


    When creating your API app, specify the JavaScript (CORS) origins you'll be
    using. We use these origins to return the headers needed for CORS.


    # Dates


    All dates will be GMT and returned in the ISO 8601 format like
    `2014-09-01T09:10:11.000Z`. Adjust accordingly in your app for the user's
    local timezone.


    # Emojis


    We use short codes for emojis like `:smiley:` and `:raised_hands:` and
    render them on the Trakt website using
    [**JoyPixels**](https://www.joypixels.com/) _(verion 6.6.0)_. Methods that
    support emojis are tagged with &#128513; **Emojis**. For POST methods, you
    can send standard unicode emojis and we'll automatically convert them to
    short codes. For GET methods, we'll return the short codes and it's up to
    your app to convert them back to unicode emojis.


    # Standard Media Objects


    All methods will accept or return standard media objects for `movie`,
    `show`, `season`, `episode`, `person`, and `user` items. Here are examples
    for all minimal objects.


    #### movie


    ```

    }

    ```


    # Images


    The standard media objects for all `movie`, `show`, `season`, `episode`, and
    `person` items include an `ids` object. These `ids` map to other services
    like [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org), [TVDB](https://thetvdb.com),
    [Fanart.tv](https://fanart.tv), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com), and
    [OMDB](https://www.omdbapi.com/).


    Most of these services have free APIs you can use to grab lots of great
    looking images. Here’s a chart to help you find the best artwork for your
    app. [**We also wrote an article to help with
    this.**](https://apiblog.trakt.tv/how-to-find-the-best-images-516045bcc3b6)

    # Website Media Links


    There are several ways to construct direct links to media on the Trakt
    website. The website itself uses slugs so the URLs are more readable.


    | Type | URL |

    |---|---|

    | `movie` | `/movies/:slug` |

    | `show` | `/shows/:slug` |

    | `season` | `/shows/:slug/seasons/:num` |

    | `episode` | `/shows/:slug/seasons/:num/episodes/:num` |

    | `person` | `/people/:slug` |

    | `comment` | `/comments/:id` |

    | `list` | `/lists/:id` |


    You can also create links using the Trakt, IMDB, TMDB, or TVDB IDs. We
    recommend using the Trakt ID if possible since that will always have full
    coverage. If you use the search url without an `id_type` it will return
    search results if multiple items are found.


    | Type | URL |

    |---|---|

    | `trakt` | `/search/trakt/:id` |

    |  | `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=movie` |

    |  | `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=show` |

    |  | `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=season` |

    |  | `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=episode` |

    |  | `/search/trakt/:id?id_type=person` |

    | `imdb` | `/search/imdb/:id` |

    | `tmdb` | `/search/tmdb/:id` |

    |  | `/search/tmdb/:id?id_type=movie` |

    |  | `/search/tmdb/:id?id_type=show` |

    |  | `/search/tmdb/:id?id_type=episode` |

    |  | `/search/tmdb/:id?id_type=person` |

    | `tvdb` | `/search/tvdb/:id` |

    |  | `/search/tvdb/:id?id_type=show` |

    |  | `/search/tvdb/:id?id_type=episode` |

        Check into a movie or episode. This should be tied to a user action to
        manually indicate they are watching something. The item will display as
        *watching* on the site, then automatically switch to *watched* status
        once the duration has elapsed. A unique history `id` (64-bit integer)
        will be returned and can be used to reference this checkin directly.


        #### JSON POST Data


        | Key | Type | Value |

        |---|---|---|

        | item <span style="color:red;">*</a> | object | `movie` or `episode`
        object. (see examples &#8594;) |

        | `sharing`  | object | Control sharing to any connected social
        networks. (see below &#8595;) |

        | `message`  | string | Message used for sharing. If not sent, it will
        use the watching string in the user settings. |


        #### Sharing


        The `sharing` object is optional and will apply the user's settings if
        not sent. If `sharing` is sent, each key will override the user's
        setting for that social network. Send `true` to post or `false` to not
        post on the indicated social network. You can see which social networks
        a user has connected with the
        [**/users/settings**](/reference/users/settings) method.


        | Key | Type |

        |---|---|

        | `twitter` | boolean |

        | `mastodon` | boolean |

        | `tumblr` | boolean |

        #### &#128274; OAuth Required &#128513; Emojis


        Add a new comment to a movie, show, season, episode, or list. Make sure
        to allow and encourage *spoilers* to be indicated in your app and follow
        the rules listed above.


        #### JSON POST Data


        | Key | Type | Default | Value |

        |---|---|---|---|

        | item <span style="color:red;">*</a> | object | | `movie`, `show`,
        `season`, `episode`, or `list` object. (see examples &#8594;) |

        | `comment` <span style="color:red;">*</a> | string |  | Text for the
        comment. |

        | `spoiler` | boolean | `false` | Is this a spoiler? |

        | `sharing`  | object | | Control sharing to any connected social
        networks. (see below &#8595;) |


        #### Sharing


        The `sharing` object is optional and will apply the user's settings if
        not sent. If `sharing` is sent, each key will override the user's
        setting for that social network. Send `true` to post or `false` to not
        post on the indicated social network. You can see which social networks
        a user has connected with the
        [**/users/settings**](/reference/users/settings) method.


        | Key | Type |

        |---|---|

        | `twitter` | boolean |

        | `tumblr` | boolean |

        | `medium` | boolean |

        Returns all replies for a comment. It is possible these replies could
        have replies themselves, so in that case you would just call
        [**/comments/:id/replies**](/reference/comments/replies/) again with the
        new comment `id`.

        optionally filter by the `comment_type` and media `type` to limit what
        gets returned. If you want to `include_replies` that will return replies
        in place alongside top level comments.

        Returns the most recently updated comments across all of Trakt. You can
        optionally filter by the `comment_type` and media `type` to limit what
        gets returned. If you want to `include_replies` that will return replies
        in place alongside top level comments.

        Emojis


        Get all items on a personal list. Items can be a `movie`, `show`,
        `season`, `episode`, or `person`. You can optionally specify the `type`
        parameter with a single value or comma delimited string for multiple
        item types.


        #### Notes


        Each list item contains a `notes` field with text entered by the user.


        #### Sorting Headers


        All list items are sorted by ascending `rank`. We also send `X-Sort-By`
        and `X-Sort-How` headers which can be used to custom sort the list _**in
        your app**_ based on the user's preference. Values for `X-Sort-By`
        include `rank`, `added`, `title`, `released`, `runtime`, `popularity`,
        `percentage`, `votes`, `my_rating`, `random`, `watched`, and
        `collected`. Values for `X-Sort-How` include `asc` and `desc`.

        Returns all `cast` and `crew` for a movie. Each `cast` member will have

        The `crew` object will be broken up by department into `production`,
        `art`, `crew`, `costume & make-up`, `directing`, `writing`, `sound`,
        `camera`, `visual effects`, `lighting`, and `editing` (if there are
        people for those crew positions). Each of those members will have a
        `jobs` array and a standard `person` object.

        Notes *(500 maximum characters)* added to a `movie`, `show`, `season`,
        `episode`, or `person` will automatically be set to `private`. You can
        send just the media item.


        Notes *(500 maximum characters)* added to a `history`, `collection`, or
        `rating` can have their `privacy` and `spoiler` set. You need to send
        the `attached_to` object so we know where to attach the note.


        #### JSON POST Data


        | Key | Type | Default | Value |

        |---|---|---|---|

        | item <span style="color:red;">*</a> | object | | `movie`, `show`,

        (see examples &#8594;) |

        | `notes` <span style="color:red;">*</a> | string |  | Text for the
        notes. |

        | `spoiler` | boolean | `false` | Is this a spoiler? |

        | `privacy` | string | `private` | `private`, `friends`, `public` |

        Returns the item this note is `attached_to`. Media items like `movie`,
        `show`, `season`, `episode`, or `person` are straightforward, but
        `history` will need to be mapped to that specific play in their watched
        history since they might have multiple plays. Since `collection` and
        `rating` is a 1:1 association, you can assume the note is attached to
        the media item in the `type` field that has been collected or rated.

        Returns all people Trakt IDs updated since the specified UTC date and
        time. We recommended storing the `X-Start-Date` header you can be
        efficient using this method moving forward. By default, `10` results are
        returned. You can send a `limit` to get up to `100` results per page.

        Returns all movies where this person is in the `cast` or `crew`. Each
        `cast` object will have a `characters` array and a standard `movie`
        object.


        The `crew` object will be broken up by department into `production`,
        `art`, `crew`, `costume & make-up`, `directing`, `writing`, `sound`,
        `camera`, `visual effects`, `lighting`, and `editing` (if there are
        people for those crew positions). Each of those members will have a
        `jobs` array and a standard `movie` object.

        TV show recommendations for a user. By default, `10` results are
        returned. You can send a `limit` to get up to `100` results per page.
        Set `ignore_collected=true` to filter out shows the user has already
        collected or `ignore_watchlisted=true` to filter out shows the user has
        already watchlisted.


        The `favorited_by` array contains all users who favorited the item along
        with any notes they added.

        Use this method when the video is paused. The playback progress will be
        saved and [**/sync/playback**](/reference/sync/playback/) can be used to
        resume the video from this exact position. Unpause a video by calling
        the [**/scrobble/start**](/reference/scrobble/start/) method again.

        Use this method when the video is stopped or finishes playing on its
        own. If the progress is above 80%, the video will be scrobbled and the
        `action` will be set to **scrobble**. A unique history `id` (64-bit
        integer) will be returned and can be used to reference this `scrobble`
        directly.


        If the progress is less than 80%, it will be treated as a *pause* and
        the `action` will be set to **pause**. The playback progress will be
        saved and [**/sync/playback**](/reference/sync/playback/) can be used to
        resume the video from this exact position.


        > ### 🅽🅾🆃🅴

        > _If you prefer to use a threshold higher than 80%, you should use
        [**/scrobble/pause**](/reference/scrobble/pause/) yourself so it doesn't
        create duplicate scrobbles._

        > _If the same item was just scrobbled, a `409` HTTP status code will
        returned to avoid scrobbling a duplicate. The response will contain a

        `expires_at` timestamp when the item can be scrobbled again._

      description: >-
        #### &#128196; Pagination &#10024; Extended Info &#127898; Filters


        Search all text fields that a media object contains (i.e. title,
        overview, etc). Results are ordered by the most relevant score. Specify
        the `type` of results by sending a single value or a comma delimited
        string for multiple types.


        #### Special Characters


        Our search engine (Solr) gives the following characters special meaning
        when they appear in a query:


        `+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : /`


        To interpret any of these characters literally (and not as a special
        character), precede the character with a backslash `\` character.


        #### Search Fields


        By default, all text fields are used to search for the `query`. You can
        optionally specify the `fields` parameter with a single value or comma
        delimited string for multiple fields. Each `type` has specific `fields`
        that can be specified. This can be useful if you want to support more
        strict searches (i.e. title only).


        | Type | Field |

        |---|---|

        | `movie` | `title` |

        |  | `tagline` |

        |  | `overview` |

        |  | `people` |

        |  | `translations` |

        |  | `aliases` |

        | `show` | `title` |

        |  | `overview` |

        |  | `people` |

        |  | `translations` |

        |  | `aliases` |

        | `episode` | `title` |

        |  | `overview` |

        Lookup items by their Trakt, IMDB, TMDB, or TVDB ID. If you use the
        search url without a `type` it might return multiple items if the
        `id_type` is not globally unique. Specify the `type` of results by
        sending a single value or a comma delimited string for multiple types.

        Returns all shows updated since the specified UTC date and time. We
        recommended storing the `X-Start-Date` header you can be efficient using
        this method moving forward. By default, `10` results are returned. You
        can send a `limit` to get up to `100` results per page.

        > _The `start_date` is only accurate to the hour, for caching purposes.
        Please drop the minutes and seconds from your timestamp to help optimize

                    overview: >-
                      Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television
                      series created for HBO by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.
                      It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R.
                      R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which
                      is titled A Game of Thrones.


                      The series, set on the fictional continents of Westeros
                      and Essos at the end of a decade-long summer, interweaves
                      several plot lines. The first follows the members of
                      several noble houses in a civil war for the Iron Throne of
                      the Seven Kingdoms; the second covers the rising threat of
                      the impending winter and the mythical creatures of the
                      North; the third chronicles the attempts of the exiled
                      last scion of the realm's deposed dynasty to reclaim the
                      throne. Through its morally ambiguous characters, the
                      series explores the issues of social hierarchy, religion,
                      loyalty, corruption, sexuality, civil war, crime, and
                      punishment.

                    Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series
                    created and produced by Vince Gilligan. Set and produced in
                    Albuquerque, New Mexico, Breaking Bad is the story of Walter
                    White, a struggling high school chemistry teacher who is
                    diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer at the beginning of
                    the series. He turns to a life of crime, producing and
                    selling methamphetamine, in order to secure his family's
                    financial future before he dies, teaming with his former
                    student, Jesse Pinkman. Heavily serialized, the series is
                    known for positioning its characters in seemingly
                    inextricable corners and has been labeled a contemporary
                    western by its creator.

      description: >-

        Returns collection progress for a show including details on all aired
        seasons and episodes. The `next_episode` will be the next episode the
        user should collect, if there are no upcoming episodes it will be set to
        `null`.


        By default, any hidden seasons will be removed from the response and
        stats. To include these and adjust the completion stats, set the
        `hidden` flag to `true`.


        By default, specials will be excluded from the response. Set the
        `specials` flag to `true` to include season 0 and adjust the stats
        accordingly. If you'd like to include specials, but not adjust the
        stats, set `count_specials` to `false`.


        By default, the `last_episode` and `next_episode` are calculated using
        the last `aired` episode the user has collected, even if they've
        collected older episodes more recently. To use their last collected
        episode for these calculations, set the `last_activity` flag to
        `collected`.

        > _Only aired episodes are used to calculate progress. Episodes in the
        future or without an air date are ignored._

        Returns watched progress for a show including details on all aired
        seasons and episodes. The `next_episode` will be the next episode the
        user should watch, if there are no upcoming episodes it will be set to
        `null`. If not `null`, the `reset_at` date is when the user started
        re-watching the show. Your app can adjust the progress by ignoring
        episodes with a `last_watched_at` prior to the `reset_at`.


        By default, any hidden seasons will be removed from the response and
        stats. To include these and adjust the completion stats, set the
        `hidden` flag to `true`.


        By default, specials will be excluded from the response. Set the
        `specials` flag to `true` to include season 0 and adjust the stats
        accordingly. If you'd like to include specials, but not adjust the
        stats, set `count_specials` to `false`.


        By default, the `last_episode` and `next_episode` are calculated using
        the last `aired` episode the user has watched, even if they've watched
        older episodes more recently. To use their last watched episode for
        these calculations, set the `last_activity` flag to `watched`.


        > ### 🅽🅾🆃🅴

        > _Only aired episodes are used to calculate progress. Episodes in the
        future or without an air date are ignored._

        `art`, `crew`, `costume & make-up`, `directing`, `writing`, `sound`,
        `camera`, `visual effects`, `lighting`, `editing`, and `created  by` (if
        there are people for those crew positions). Each of those members will
        have a `jobs` array and a standard `person` object.


        #### Guest Stars


        If you add `?extended=guest_stars` to the URL, it will return all guest
        stars that appeared in at least 1 episode of the show.

        #### &#10024; Extended Info


        Returns all `cast` and `crew` for a season, including the
        `episode_count` for which they appear. Each `cast` member will have a
        `characters` array and a standard `person` object.


        The `crew` object will be broken up by department into `production`,
        `art`, `crew`, `costume & make-up`, `directing`, `writing`, `sound`,
        `camera`, `visual effects`, `lighting`, and `editing` (if there are
        people for those crew positions).. Each of those members will have a
        `jobs` array and a standard `person` object.


        #### Guest Stars


        If you add `?extended=guest_stars` to the URL, it will return all guest
        stars that appeared in at least 1 episode of the season.

                    一名守夜人军团的逃兵在临冬城外被抓获，领主艾德（奈德）·史塔克下令将其处斩。奈德对绝境长城之外的形势忧心忡忡。行刑结束后，奈德回到城中，他的夫人凯特琳带来一个令人震惊的消息：奈德的良师益友、现任首相琼恩·艾林在都城离奇死亡，罗伯特国王正启程赶往北方，希望奈德接替琼恩·艾林出任国王之手。与此同时，在狭海对岸的潘托斯，韦赛里斯·坦格利安正计划与多斯拉克游牧民族的一位重要首领卓戈卡奥结盟，凭借多斯拉克人的力量夺回本属于他的铁王座。他妹妹丹妮莉斯的终身幸福成了他手中最重要的筹码。罗伯特国王带着瑟曦·兰尼斯特王后及兰尼斯特家族的重要成员抵达临冬城。他的随行人员包括：王后的弟弟詹姆和提力昂，他们一个英俊潇洒，一个却是侏儒；12岁的乔佛里王子，王位的继承人。奈德无法拒绝国王的盛情邀请，决定南下君临城帮助国王稳定国内局势。就在罗伯特和奈德动身之前，奈德的私生子琼恩·雪诺决定北上黑城堡加盟守夜人军团，对守夜人颇为好奇的提力昂打算和雪诺一同前往。厄运突然降临到奈德的次子布兰身上，奈德和琼恩都被迫推迟了行程。

        #### &#10024; Extended Info


        Returns all `cast` and `crew` for an episode. Each `cast` member will
        have a `characters` array and a standard `person` object.


        The `crew` object will be broken up by department into `production`,
        `art`, `crew`, `costume & make-up`, `directing`, `writing`, `sound`,
        `camera`, `visual effects`, `lighting`, and `editing` (if there are
        people for those crew positions). Each of those members will have a
        `jobs` array and a standard `person` object.


        #### Guest Stars


        If you add `?extended=guest_stars` to the URL, it will return all guest
        stars that appeared in the episode.

        #### &#128274; OAuth Required


        This method is a useful first step in the syncing process. We
        recommended caching these dates locally, then you can compare to know
        exactly what data has changed recently. This can greatly optimize your
        syncs so you don't pull down a ton of data only to see nothing has
        actually changed.


        #### Account


        `settings_at` is set when the OAuth user updates any of their Trakt
        settings on the website. `followed_at` is set when another Trakt user
        follows or unfollows the OAuth user. `following_at` is set when the
        OAuth user follows or unfollows another Trakt user. `pending_at` is set
        when the OAuth user follows a private account, which requires their
        approval. `requested_at` is set when the OAuth user has a private
        account and someone requests to follow them.

        #### &#128274; OAuth Required &#128196; Pagination Optional


        Whenever a scrobble is paused, the playback progress is saved. Use this
        progress to sync up playback across different media centers or apps. For
        example, you can start watching a movie in a media center, stop it, then
        resume on your tablet from the same spot. Each item will have the
        `progress` percentage between 0 and 100.


        You can optionally specify a `type` to only get `movies` or `episodes`.


        By default, all results will be returned. Pagination is optional and can

        Get all collected items in a user's collection. A collected item
        indicates availability to watch digitally or on physical media.


        Each `movie` object contains `collected_at` and `updated_at` timestamps.
        Since users can set custom dates when they collected movies, it is
        possible for `collected_at` to be in the past. We also include
        `updated_at` to help sync Trakt data with your app. Cache this timestamp
        locally and only re-process the movie if you see a newer timestamp.


        Each `show` object contains `last_collected_at` and `last_updated_at`
        timestamps. Since users can set custom dates when they collected
        episodes, it is possible for `last_collected_at` to be in the past. We
        also include `last_updated_at` to help sync Trakt data with your app.
        Cache this timestamp locally and only re-process the show if you see a
        newer timestamp.


        If you add `?extended=metadata` to the URL, it will return the
        additional `media_type`, `resolution`, `hdr`, `audio`, `audio_channels`
        and '3d' metadata. It will use `null` if the metadata isn't set for an
        item.

        Add items to a user's collection. Accepts shows, seasons, episodes and
        movies. If only a show is passed, all episodes for the show will be
        collected. If seasons are specified, all episodes in those seasons will
        be collected.


        Send a `collected_at` UTC datetime to mark items as collected in the
        past. You can also send additional metadata about the media itself to
        have a very accurate collection. Showcase what is available to watch
        from your epic HD DVD collection down to your downloaded iTunes movies.

        #### &#128274; OAuth Required &#10024; Extended Info


        Returns all movies or shows a user has watched sorted by most plays.


        If `type` is set to _shows_ and you add `?extended=noseasons` to the
        URL, it won't return season or episode info.


        Each `movie` and `show` object contains `last_watched_at` and
        `last_updated_at` timestamps. Since users can set custom dates when they
        watched movies and episodes, it is possible for `last_watched_at` to be
        in the past. We also include `last_updated_at` to help sync Trakt data
        with your app. Cache this timestamp locally and only re-process the
        movies and shows if you see a newer timestamp.


        Each `show` object contains a `reset_at` timestamp. If not `null`, this
        is when the user started re-watching the show. Your app can adjust the
        progress by ignoring episodes with a `last_watched_at` prior to the
        `reset_at`.

        Info


        Returns movies and episodes that a user has watched, sorted by most
        recent. You can optionally limit the `type` to `movies` or `episodes`.
        The `id` _(64-bit integer)_ in each history item uniquely identifies the
        event and can be used to remove individual events by using the
        [**/sync/history/remove**](#reference/sync/remove-from-history/get-watched-history)
        method. The `action` will be set to `scrobble`, `checkin`, or `watch`.


        Specify a `type` and trakt `id` to limit the history for just that item.
        If the `id` is valid, but there is no history, an empty array will be
        returned.


        | Example URL | Returns watches for... |

        |---|---|

        | `/history/movies/12601` | TRON: Legacy |

        | `/history/shows/1388` | All episodes of Breaking Bad |

        | `/history/seasons/3950` | All episodes of Breaking Bad: Season 1 |

        | `/history/episodes/73482` | Only episode 1 of Breaking Bad: Season 1 |

        Add items to a user's watch history. Accepts shows, seasons, episodes
        and movies. If only a show is passed, all episodes for the show will be
        added. If seasons are specified, only episodes in those seasons will be
        added.


        Send a `watched_at` UTC datetime to mark items as watched in the past.
        This is useful for syncing past watches from a media center.

        #### &#128274; OAuth Required


        Remove items from a user's watch history including all watches,
        scrobbles, and checkins. Accepts shows, seasons, episodes and movies. If
        only a show is passed, all episodes for the show will be removed. If
        seasons are specified, only episodes in those seasons will be removed.


        You can also send a list of raw history `ids` _(64-bit integers)_ to
        delete single plays from the watched history. The
        [**/sync/history**](#reference/sync/get-history) method will return an
        individual `id` _(64-bit integer)_ for each history item.

        Rate one or more items. Accepts shows, seasons, episodes and movies. If
        only a show is passed, only the show itself will be rated. If seasons
        are specified, all of those seasons will be rated.


        Send a `rated_at` UTC datetime to mark items as rated in the past. This
        is useful for syncing ratings from a media center.

        #### &#128274; OAuth Required &#128196; Pagination Optional &#10024;
        Extended Info &#128513; Emojis


        Returns all items in a user's watchlist filtered by type.


        #### Notes


        Each watchlist item contains a `notes` field with text entered by the
        user.


        #### Sorting Headers


        By default, all list items are sorted by `rank` `asc`. We send
        `X-Applied-Sort-By` and `X-Applied-Sort-How` headers to indicate how the
        results are actually being sorted.


        We also send `X-Sort-By` and `X-Sort-How` headers which indicate the
        user's sort preference. Use these to to custom sort the watchlist _**in
        your app**_ for more advanced sort abilities we can't do in the API.
        Values for `X-Sort-By` include `rank`, `added`, `title`, `released`,
        `runtime`, `popularity`, `percentage`, and `votes`. Values for
        `X-Sort-How` include `asc` and `desc`.


        #### Auto Removal


        When an item is watched, it will be automatically removed from the
        watchlist. For shows and seasons, watching 1 episode will remove the
        entire show or season.


        _**The watchlist should not be used as a list of what the user is
        actively watching.**_


        Use a combination of the
        [**/sync/watched**](/reference/sync/get-watched) and
        [**/shows/:id/progress**](/reference/shows/watched-progress) methods to
        get what the user is actively watching.

        #### 🔥 VIP Enhanced &#128274; OAuth Required &#128513; Emojis


        Add one of more items to a user's watchlist. Accepts shows, seasons,
        episodes and movies. If only a show is passed, only the show itself will
        be added. If seasons are specified, all of those seasons will be added.


        #### Notes


        Each watchlist item can optionally accept a `notes` *(500 maximum
        characters)* field with custom text. The user must be a [**Trakt
        VIP**](https://trakt.tv/vip) to send `notes`.


        #### Limits


        If the user's watchlist limit is exceeded, a `420` HTTP error code is
        returned. Use the [**/users/settings**](/reference/users/settings)
        method to get all limits for a user account. In most cases, upgrading to
        [**Trakt VIP**](https://trakt.tv/vip) will increase the limits.


        #### JSON POST Data


        | Key | Type | Value |

        If the user only had 50 TV shows and movies to bring with them on a
        deserted island, what would they be? These favorites are used to
        enchance Trakt's social recommendation algorithm. Apps should encourage
        user's to add favorites so the algorithm keeps getting better.


        #### Notes


        Each favorite contains a `notes` field explaining why the user favorited
        the item.

        If the user only had 50 TV shows and movies to bring with them on a
        deserted island, what would they be? These favorites are used to
        enchance Trakt's social recommendation algorithm. Apps should encourage
        user's to add favorites so the algorithm keeps getting better.


        #### Notes


        Each favorite can optionally accept a `notes` *(500 maximum characters)*
        field explaining why the user favorited the item.


        #### Limits


        If the user has favorited 50 items already, a `420` HTTP error code is
        returned. This limit applies to all users.

        Get the user's settings so you can align your app's experience with what
        they're used to on the trakt website. A globally unique `uuid` is also
        returned, which can be used to identify the user locally in your app if
        needed. However, the `uuid` can't be used to retrieve data from the
        Trakt API.

        Get a user's profile information. If the user is private, info will only
        be returned if you send OAuth and are either that user or an approved
        follower. Adding `?extended=vip` will return some additional VIP related
        fields so you can display the user's Trakt VIP status and year count.

        #### &#128274; OAuth Optional &#128196; Pagination


        Get items a user likes. This will return an array of standard media
        objects. You can optionally limit the `type` of results to return.


        #### Comment Media Objects


        If you add `?extended=comments` to the URL, it will return media objects
        for each comment like.

        Get all collected items in a user's collection. A collected item
        indicates availability to watch digitally or on physical media.


        Each `movie` object contains `collected_at` and `updated_at` timestamps.
        Since users can set custom dates when they collected movies, it is
        possible for `collected_at` to be in the past. We also include
        `updated_at` to help sync Trakt data with your app. Cache this timestamp
        locally and only re-process the movie if you see a newer timestamp.


        Each `show` object contains `last_collected_at` and `last_updated_at`
        timestamps. Since users can set custom dates when they collected
        episodes, it is possible for `last_collected_at` to be in the past. We
        also include `last_updated_at` to help sync Trakt data with your app.
        Cache this timestamp locally and only re-process the show if you see a
        newer timestamp.


        If you add `?extended=metadata` to the URL, it will return the
        additional `media_type`, `resolution`, `hdr`, `audio`, `audio_channels`
        and '3d' metadata. It will use `null` if the metadata isn't set for an
        item.

        Info


        Returns the most recently written comments for the user. You can
        optionally filter by the `comment_type` and media `type` to limit what
        gets returned.


        By default, only top level comments are returned. Set
        `?include_replies=true` to return replies in addition to top level
        comments. Set `?include_replies=only` to return only replies and no top
        level comments.

        &#10024; Extended Info


        Returns the most recently notes for the user. You can optionally filter
        by media `type` to limit what gets returned. Use the `attached_to` info
        to know what the note is actually added to. Media items like `movie`,
        `show`, `season`, `episode`, or `person` are straightforward, but
        `history` will need to be mapped to that specific play in their watched
        history since they might have multiple plays. Since `collection` and
        `rating` is a 1:1 association, you can assume the note is attached to
        the media item in the `type` field that has been collected or rated.

        #### 🔥 VIP Enhanced &#128274; OAuth Required


        Create a new personal list. The `name` is the only required field, but
        the other info is recommended to ask for.


        #### Limits


        If the user's list limit is exceeded, a `420` HTTP error code is
        returned. Use the [**/users/settings**](/reference/users/settings)
        method to get all limits for a user account. In most cases, upgrading to
        [**Trakt VIP**](https://trakt.tv/vip) will increase the limits.


        #### Privacy


        Lists will be `private` by default. Here is what each value means.


        | Value | Privacy impact... |

        |---|---|

        | `private` | Only you can see the list. |

        | `link` | Anyone with the `share_link` can see the list. |

        | `friends` | Only your friends can see the list. |

        | `public` | Anyone can see the list. |


        #### JSON POST Data


        | Key | Type | Default | Value |

        |---|---|---|---|

        | `name` <span style="color:red;">*</a> | string |  | Name of the list.

        Returns all lists a user can collaborate on. This gives full access to
        add, remove, and re-order list items. It essentially works just like a
        list owned by the user, just make sure to use the correct list owner
        `user` when building the API URLs.

        Update a personal list by sending 1 or more parameters. If you update
        the list name, the original slug will still be retained so existing
        references to this list won't break.


        #### Privacy


        Lists will be `private` by default. Here is what each value means.


        | Value | Privacy impact... |

        |---|---|

        | `private` | Only you can see the list. |

        | `link` | Anyone with the `share_link` can see the list. |

        | `friends` | Only your friends can see the list. |

        | `public` | Anyone can see the list. |


        #### JSON POST Data


        | Key | Type | Value |

        |---|---|---|---|

        | `name` | string | Name of the list. |

        | `description` | string | Description for this list. |

        | `privacy` | string | `private`, `link`, `friends`, `public` |

        | `display_numbers` | boolean | Should each item be numbered? |

        | `allow_comments` | boolean | Are comments allowed? |

        | `sort_by` | string | `rank`, `added`, `title`, `released`, `runtime`,
        `popularity`, `percentage`, `votes`, `my_rating`, `random`, `watched`,
        `collected` |

        | `sort_how` | string | `asc`, `desc` |

        Get all items on a personal list. Items can be a `movie`, `show`,
        `season`, `episode`, or `person`. You can optionally specify the `type`
        parameter with a single value or comma delimited string for multiple
        item types.


        #### Notes


        Each list item contains a `notes` field with text entered by the user.


        #### Sorting Headers


        All list items are sorted by ascending `rank`. We also send `X-Sort-By`
        and `X-Sort-How` headers which can be used to custom sort the list _**in
        your app**_ based on the user's preference. Values for `X-Sort-By`
        include `rank`, `added`, `title`, `released`, `runtime`, `popularity`,
        `percentage`, `votes`, `my_rating`, `random`, `watched`, and
        `collected`. Values for `X-Sort-How` include `asc` and `desc`.

        #### 🔥 VIP Enhanced &#128274; OAuth Required &#128513; Emojis


        Add one or more items to a personal list. Items can be movies, shows,
        seasons, episodes, or people.


        #### Notes


        Each list item can optionally accept a `notes` *(500 maximum
        characters)* field with custom text. The user must be a [**Trakt
        VIP**](https://trakt.tv/vip) to send `notes`.


        #### Limits


        If the user's list item limit is exceeded, a `420` HTTP error code is
        returned. Use the [**/users/settings**](/reference/users/settings)
        method to get all limits for a user account. In most cases, upgrading to
        [**Trakt VIP**](https://trakt.tv/vip) will increase the limits.

        If the user has a private profile, the follow request will require
        approval (`approved_at` will be null). If a user is public, they will be
        followed immediately (`approved_at` will have a date).

        Info


        Returns movies and episodes that a user has watched, sorted by most
        recent. You can optionally limit the `type` to `movies` or `episodes`.
        The `id` _(64-bit integer)_ in each history item uniquely identifies the
        event and can be used to remove individual events by using the
        [**/sync/history/remove**](#reference/sync/remove-from-history/get-watched-history)
        method. The `action` will be set to `scrobble`, `checkin`, or `watch`.


        Specify a `type` and trakt `item_id` to limit the history for just that
        item. If the `item_id` is valid, but there is no history, an empty array
        will be returned.


        | Example URL | Returns watches for... |

        |---|---|

        | `/history/movies/12601` | TRON: Legacy |

        | `/history/shows/1388` | All episodes of Breaking Bad |

        | `/history/seasons/3950` | All episodes of Breaking Bad: Season 1 |

        | `/history/episodes/73482` | Only episode 1 for Breaking Bad: Season 1

        Extended Info &#128513; Emojis


        Returns all items in a user's watchlist filtered by type.


        #### Notes


        Each watchlist item contains a `notes` field with text entered by the
        user.


        #### Sorting Headers


        By default, all list items are sorted by `rank` `asc`. We send
        `X-Applied-Sort-By` and `X-Applied-Sort-How` headers to indicate how the
        results are actually being sorted.


        We also send `X-Sort-By` and `X-Sort-How` headers which indicate the
        user's sort preference. Use these to to custom sort the watchlist _**in
        your app**_ for more advanced sort abilities we can't do in the API.
        Values for `X-Sort-By` include `rank`, `added`, `title`, `released`,
        `runtime`, `popularity`, `percentage`, and `votes`. Values for
        `X-Sort-How` include `asc` and `desc`.


        #### Auto Removal


        When an item is watched, it will be automatically removed from the
        watchlist. For shows and seasons, watching 1 episode will remove the
        entire show or season.


        _**The watchlist should not be used as a list of what the user is
        actively watching.**_


        Use a combination of the
        [**/sync/watched**](/reference/sync/get-watched) and
        [**/shows/:id/progress**](/reference/shows/watched-progress) methods to
        get what the user is actively watching.

        #### &#128275; OAuth Optional &#10024; Extended Info


        Returns all movies or shows a user has watched sorted by most plays.


        If `type` is set to _shows_ and you add `?extended=noseasons` to the
        URL, it won't return season or episode info.


        Each `movie` and `show` object contains `last_watched_at` and
        `last_updated_at` timestamps. Since users can set custom dates when they
        watched movies and episodes, it is possible for `last_watched_at` to be
        in the past. We also include `last_updated_at` to help sync Trakt data
        with your app. Cache this timestamp locally and only re-process the
        movies and shows if you see a newer timestamp.


        Each `show` object contains a `reset_at` timestamp. If not `null`, this
        is when the user started re-watching the show. Your app can adjust the
        progress by ignoring episodes with a `last_watched_at` prior to the
        `reset_at`.

  - name: Authentication - OAuth
    description: >-
      The API uses OAuth2.  If you know what's up with OAuth2, grab your library
      and starting rolling. If you have access to a web browser (mobile app,
      desktop app, website), use standard **OAuth**. If you don't have web
      browser access (media center plugins, smart watches, smart TVs, command
      line scripts, system services), use **Device** authentication.


      To obtain a `client_id` and `client_secret`, create an application on the
      Trakt website. Here are some helpful links to get your started:


      - [Create a new API app](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new)


      - [View your API apps](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications)


      ---


      #### Application Flow


      1. **Redirect to request Trakt access.** Using the
      [**/oauth/authorize**](/reference/authentication-oauth/authorize) method,
      construct then redirect to this URL. The Trakt website will request
      permissions for your app and the user will have the opportunity to sign up
      for a new Trakt account or sign in with their existing account.


      2. **Trakt redirects back to your site.** If the user accepts your
      request, Trakt redirects back to your site with a temporary code in a
      `code` GET parameter as well as the state (if provided) in the previous
      step in a `state` parameter. If the states don’t match, the request has
      been created by a third party and the process should be aborted.


      3. **Exchange the code for an access token.** If everything looks good in
      step 2, exchange the `code` for an access token using the
      [**/oauth/token**](reference/authentication-oauth/get-token/) method. Save
      the `access_token` so your app can authenticate the user by sending the
      `Authorization` header as indicated below or in any example code. The
      `access_token` is valid for 3 months. Save and use the `refresh_token` to
      get a new `access_token` without asking the user to re-authenticate.
  - name: Authentication - Devices
    description: >-
      Device authentication is for apps and services with limited input or
      display capabilities. This include media center plugins, smart watches,
      smart TVs, command line scripts, and system services.


      Your app displays an alphanumeric code (typically 8 characters) to the
      user. They are then instructed to visit the verification URL on their
      computer or mobile device. After entering the code, the user will be
      prompted to grant permission for your app. After your app gets
      permissions, the device receives an `access_token` and works like standard
      OAuth from that point on. More details below.


      ---


      #### Application Flow


      1. **Generate codes.** Your app calls
      [**/oauth/device/code**](/reference/authentication-devices/code) to
      generate new codes. Save this entire response for later use.


      2. **Display the code.** Display the `user_code` and instruct the user to
      visit the `verification_url` on their computer or mobile device.


      3. **Poll for authorization.** Poll the
      [**/oauth/device/token**](/reference/authentication-devices/token) method
      to see if the user successfully authorizes your app. Use the `device_code`
      and poll at the `interval` (in seconds) to check if the user has
      authorized your app. Check the docs below for the specific error codes you
      need to handle. Use `expires_in` to stop polling after that many seconds,
      and gracefully instruct the user to restart the process. **It is important
      to poll at the correct interval and also stop polling when expired.**


      4. **Successful authorization.** When you receive a `200` success
      response, save the `access_token` so your app can authenticate the user in
      methods that require it. The `access_token` is valid for 3 months. Save
      and use the `refresh_token` to get a new `access_token` without asking the
      user to re-authenticate. It's normal OAuth from this point.


      ---


      #### User Flow


      1. **Call to action.** Consider your user experience when asking a user to
      connect their Trakt account. For some devices this will be right away, and
      for others it might be later in the experience.


      2. **Display the code.** When a user clicks the call to action, your app
      calls [**/oauth/device/code**](/reference/authentication-devices/code) to
      generate new codes. In your UI, display the `user_code` and instruct the
      user to visit the `verification_url` on their computer or mobile device.
      The `user_code` is typically 8 characters, so make sure there is enough
      room to display the full code.


      3. **Authorizing your app.** When the user visits the `verification_url`
      it first checks to make sure they're signed in. If not signed in, they'll
      be able to or can sign up for a new account. After entering the code, the
      user will be prompted to grant permission for your app. Once approved, the
      user will see a success message indicating their device is connected.


      4. **Confirm successful authorization.** Your app will be polling to see
      if the user successfully authorizes your app. Once they have, refresh your
      UI to indicate a successful connection has been made.
  - name: Calendars
    description: >-
      By default, the calendar will return all shows or movies for the specified
      time period and can be global or user specific. The `start_date` defaults
      to today and `days` to 7. The maximum amount of `days` you can send is
      `33`. All dates (including the `start_date` and `first_aired`) are in UTC,
      so it's up to your app to handle any offsets based on the user's time
      zone.


      The `my` calendar displays episodes for all shows that have been watched,
      collected, or watchlisted plus individual episodes on the watchlist. It
      will remove any shows that have been hidden from the calendar. The `all`
      calendar displays info for all shows airing during the specified period.
  - name: Checkin
    description: >-
      Checking in is a manual action used by mobile apps allowing the user to
      indicate what they are watching right now. While not as effortless as
      scrobbling, checkins help fill in the gaps. You might be watching live tv,
      at a friend's house, or watching a movie in theaters. You can simply
      checkin from your phone or tablet in those situations. The item will
      display as *watching* on the site, then automatically switch to *watched*
      status once the duration has elapsed.
  - name: Certifications
  - name: Comments
    description: >-
      Comments are attached to any movie, show, season, episode, or list and can
      be a quick shout or a more detailed review. Each comment can have replies
      and can be liked. These likes are used to determine popular comments.
      Comments must follow these rules and your app should indicate these to the
      user. Failure to adhere to these rules could suspend the user's commenting
      abilities.


      - Comments must be at least 5 words.


      - Comments 200 words or longer will be automatically marked as a review.


      - Correctly indicate if the comment contains spoilers.


      - Only write comments in English - **This is important!**


      - **Do not include** app specific text like (via App Name) or #apphashtag.
      This clutters up the comments and failure to clean the comment text could
      get your app blacklisted from commenting.


      #### Possible Error Responses


      | Code | Description |

      |---|---|

      | `401` | Invalid user

      | `401` | User banned from commenting

      | `404` | Item not found or doesn't allow comments

      | `409` | Comment can't be deleted

      | `422` | Validation errors


      #### Validation Errors


      If a comment doesn't pass validation, it returns a `422` HTTP error code
      and an array of validation errors in the response. The validation errors
      could include:


      | Error Message |

      |---|

      | `must be at least 5 words` |

      | `must be written in English` |


      #### Comment Formatting


      Comments support [**markdown**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
      formatting so you'll want to render this in your app so it matches what
      the website does. In addition, we support inline spoiler tags like
      `[spoiler]text[/spoiler]` which you should also handle independent of the
      top level `spoiler` attribute.
  - name: Countries
  - name: Genres
  - name: Languages
  - name: Lists
  - name: Movies
  - name: Networks
  - name: Notes
    description: >-
      Notes *(500 maximum characters)* attached to any `movie`, `show`,
      `season`, `episode`, or `person` and are only visible to the user who
      created them. They are also set to `private` and can't be marked as a
      `spoiler`. Notes attached to any `history`, `collection`, or `rating` can
      have their `privacy` and `spoiler` set.


      #### Possible Error Responses


      | Code | Description |

      |---|---|

      | `401` | Invalid user

      | `404` | Item not found or doesn't allow notes

      | `409` | Note can't be deleted

      | `422` | Validation errors
  - name: People
  - name: Recommendations
    description: >-
      Trakt social recommendations use all the `Favorites` lists from the users
      you follow. The more users you follow with similar tastes, the better your
      recommendations will be. We also use other factors for the algorithm to
      further personalize what gets recommended.
  - name: Scrobble
    description: >-
      Scrobbling is an automatic way to track what a user is watching in a media
      center. The media center should send events that correspond to starting,
      pausing, and stopping (or finishing) watching a movie or episode.
  - name: Search
    description: >-
      Searches can use queries or ID lookups. Queries will search text fields
      like the title and overview. ID lookups are helpful if you have an
      external ID and want to get the Trakt ID and info. These methods can
      search for movies, shows, episodes, people, and lists.
  - name: Shows
  - name: Seasons
  - name: Episodes
  - name: Sync
    description: >-
      Syncing with trakt opens up quite a few cool features. Most importantly,
      trakt can serve as a cloud based backup for the data in your app. This is
      especially useful when rebuilding a media center or installing a mobile
      app on your new phone. It can also be nice to sync up multiple media
      centers with a central trakt account. If everything is in sync, your media
      can be managed from trakt and be reflected in your apps.


      ### Media objects for syncing


      As a baseline, all *add* and *remove* sync methods accept arrays of
      `movies`, `shows`, and `episodes`. Each of these top level array elements
      should themselves be an array of standard `movie`, `show`, or `episode`
      objects. Full examples are in the intro section called **Standard Media
      Objects**. Keep in mind that `episode` objects really only need the `ids`
      so it can find an exact match. This is useful for absolute ordered shows.
      Some methods also have optional metadata you can attach, so check the docs
      for each specific method.


      Media objects will be matched by ID first, then fall back to title and
      year. IDs will be matched in this order `trakt`, `imdb`, `tmdb`, `tvdb`,
      and `slug`. If nothing is found, it will match on the `title` and `year`.
      If still nothing, it would use just the `title` (or `name` for people) and
      find the most current object that exists.


      ### Watched History Sync


      This is a 2 way sync that will get items from trakt to sync locally, plus
      find anything new and sync back to trakt. Perform this sync on startup or
      at set intervals (i.e. once every day) to keep everything in sync. *This
      will only send data to trakt and not remove it.*


      ### Collection Sync


      It's very handy to have a snapshot on trakt of everything you have
      available to watch locally. Syncing your local connection will do just
      that. *This will only send data to trakt and not remove it.*


      ### Clean Collection


      Cleaning a collection involves comparing the trakt collection to what
      exists locally. This will remove items from the trakt collection if they
      don't exist locally anymore. You should make this clear to the user that
      data might be removed from trakt.
  - name: Users
    description: >-
      User's with public data will return info with all GET methods. Private
      user's (including yourself) require valid OAuth and a friend relationship
      to return data.


      ### Username vs. Slug


      All `users` methods should use the `slug` to identify the user. The `slug`
      is a URL safe and globally unique version of the `username`.


      ### Special ID for the OAuth user


      If you send valid OAuth, you can use `me` to identify the OAuth user
      instead of needing their actual slug. You can of course still use their
      actual slug, it's up to you.


      ### Extra Headers


      If valid OAuth is sent, additional headers will be sent to better
      determine it is a data permissions issue (they aren't friends) and not bad
      OAuth. For example, you might try and access a private user's list you
      aren't friends with. This will return a `401` HTTP status code and the
      additional headers. This means the OAuth is valid, but authorization
      ultimately failed because there is no friend relationship.


      | Header | Value |

      |---|---|

      | `X-Private-User` | `true` or `false` |


      ### Creating New Users


      Since the API uses OAuth, users can create a new account during that flow
      if they need to. As far as your app is concerned, you'll still receive
      OAuth tokens no matter if they sign in with an existing account or create
      a new one.
